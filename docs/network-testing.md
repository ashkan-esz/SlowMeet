# Network impairment testing

LowMeet should be tested with two or more browsers while applying impairment
to the client network namespace or interface. These commands require Linux
`iproute2` and usually root privileges.

Inspect the active interface first:

```sh
ip route get 1.1.1.1
```

Apply one scenario at a time:

```sh
# 1 Mbps, 50 ms RTT, no loss
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 1mbit delay 50ms

# 500 kbps, 100 ms RTT, 1% loss
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 500kbit delay 100ms loss 1%

# 200 kbps, 200 ms RTT, 3% loss
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 200kbit delay 200ms loss 3%

# 100 kbps, 300 ms RTT, 5% loss
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 100kbit delay 300ms loss 5%
```

Remove impairment after every test:

```sh
sudo tc qdisc del dev IFACE root
```

## Expected behavior

| Available bandwidth | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Mbps | 360p–480p video and clear audio |
| 300–500 kbps | 240p–360p video and usable audio |
| 100–200 kbps | Very low or disabled video; audio remains usable |
| Increased loss/jitter | Video degrades before audio |

Also test a changing link by replacing the qdisc during a live call:

```sh
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 1mbit delay 50ms
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 200kbit delay 200ms loss 3%
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 80kbit delay 300ms loss 5%
sudo tc qdisc replace dev IFACE root netem rate 1mbit delay 50ms
```

Record for each run:

- Whether audio remains understandable
- Time until video downgrades
- Whether video reaches audio-only mode
- Time until video recovers
- RTT, packet loss, bitrate, FPS, and resolution from the diagnostics panel
- Whether the WebSocket or ICE connection reconnects

Do not run these commands on a shared production interface. `tc` changes the
interface for all traffic handled by that namespace.
